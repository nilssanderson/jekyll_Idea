        "description": "Since the hype from Pokemon Go in 2016, geoloaction apps have soared in interest. <br />Local businesses have been trying to get themselves 'on the map' and we have been helping them. <br /><br />Until now it has felt like a very seperated approach with local businesses asking us to create an app that would allow their customers to participate in a unique trail. <br /><br />After creating numerous apps we felt there needed to be a unified approach that allowed businesses to create their own branded trails and offer it to their own clients, without the need for creating an individual app everytime. <br/><br/>And so, <span class='dot'>traily</span> was born."
